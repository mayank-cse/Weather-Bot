# Weather-Bot
This is a simple bot which interacts with the user , asks for the postal code and the tells the weather around them.

With the LUIS ML Model enabled, which is a machine learning based service to build natural language into bots, it's much more interactive.
You can ask questions like
"What is the weather around me?"
"What is the weather at 98055"
"How can you help me with?"
"Can you help me?"
"can you please cancel"

Instruction - As the API used is for US kindly use pincode's like {98052, 98053 or 98055}
//The bot only accepts 5 digit pincode.
